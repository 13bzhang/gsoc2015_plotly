# Tests for ggplotly

## Test 1
I made a ```ggplot2``` scatterplot using the ```Orange``` dataset and pushed it up to plot.ly. The .png file is in the repo. The plot.ly plot is here: https://plot.ly/~13bzhang/143/circumference-vs-age/

## Test 2
I manually constructed a list and converted it to a JSON file. Update: I was able to push it up to plot.ly after converting my data from lists to numeric vectors.

## Test 3
I used ```testthat``` to test if salient features of my plot were correctly converted by the function ```gg2list```. The salient features were converted correctly.
